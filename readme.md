---

## Setup Instructions

If you want to build the **SecureMe** system yourself, follow the instructions provided below.

### Hardware Setup
- Place the power supply in the top of your breadboard.
- Configure the power supply using the jumper caps to set one set of rails to 3.3V and the other to 5V+.
- Place the microcontroller just under the power supply (making sure to leave room for USB).
- Connect VSYS on the Pico to VCC and then connect GND.
- Place the tilt switch sensor just beneath the microcontroller.
- Place the passive buzzer beneath the tilt switch sensor.
- Mount two small buttons for volume control on one side of the board beside the buzzer.
- Mount three larger buttons vertically down the middle of the board.
- Mount the high intensity microphone sensor to the side of the bottom two vertical buttons.
- Connect one leg of the buzzer to the GND rail and the other leg to GPIO1.
- Connect the left leg of the PIR sensor to the 5V power rail and the right leg to GND, then connect the middle leg to GPIO2.
- Connect one leg of the tilt switch to VCC and the other leg to GPIO3.
- Connect the vertical buttons starting from the bottom to VCC and GPIO4, 5, and 6.
- Connect the four pins on the right side of the matrix keypad to GPIO7, 8, 9, and 10 starting from the leftmost pin.
- Connect the four pins on the left side of the matrix keypad to GPIO11, 12, 13, and 14 starting from the leftmost pin.
- Connect the two volume buttons to VCC and GPIO15 and 16.
- Connect VCC on the microphone sensor to 5V and connect GND, then connect AO to GPIO26 and DO to GPIO17.
- Adjust the sensitivity and range of the PIR motion sensor as required.
- Adjust the sensitivity of the high intensity microphone sensor as required.
- Ensure all connections are secure and components are powered.

### Software Setup
- Flash the microcontroller with MicroPython/CircuitPython firmware.
- On your host machine, create a Python virtual environment.
- Install rshell and mpy-crosss and copy the **"src"** directory to the virtual environment.
- Copy the **"make"** file to the virtual environment and run the script.
- Connect your Pico to the computer and launch rshell.
- Upload the contents of the SecureMe build directory to the microcontroller.

### Starting The System
- Connect the SecureMe system to power using the breadboard power supply.
- After a second or so, you will hear the start-up sound and then a bell will begin to chime.
- Wait for 60 sec for the PIR sensor to warm up. The bell will stop chiming and the system ready indicator will sound.

### Network Configuration
   - Connect to the device's hotspot to access the captive portal.
   - Note: The password is ***"secureme"***.
   - Connect to the captive portal. If not automatically redirected, visit [http://192.168.4.1](http://192.168.4.1).
   - Scan for wireless networks and enter your Wi-Fi credentials to establish network connectivity.

### Web Interface
- Use a network scanner to locate the new device on your network and make a note of the IP address.
- Access the web interface using the device's IP address to configure and customize settings.
- If you are unable to obtain the IP address, try connecting using the hostname ***"SecureMe"***.
- Login with the username **"admin"** and password **"secureme"** and change the password.
- You can configure detection settings as well as Pushover notification settings for system and alarm notifications.
- You can additionally modify the web administration password and system security code.

## Usage
The SecureMe system is simple to use.

On the breadboard, starting from the bottom you have the arming button, the alarm test button and the alarm sound switch button.

The only other buttons on the board are the buzzer volume buttons.

1. **Arming And Disarming**
   - Press the arm button at the bottom of the breadboard. You will hear a bell.
   - Type the default security code **"0000"** using the matrix keypad and press **hash**.
   - A bell will sound for 10 sec and the system will be armed or disarmed.
   - You can tell if the system was armed or disarmed via the indicator after the bell.
   - The armed indicator will flash the system LED every second to indicate that the system is armed.

2. **Testing The Alarm**
   - You can test the alarm using the middle button in the vertical row on the breadboard.

3. **Changing Alarm Sound**
   - Press the top button in the vertical row to change the alarm sound.
   - The alarm sound setting is automatically saved when the alarm sound changes.

4. **Locking And Unlocking The Keypad**
   - Press the **A** key on the matrix keypad to lock and unlock the keypad.
   - The keypad locked indicator will sound with different tones when the keypad is locked and unlocked.

5. **Switching Alarm Modes**
   - You can switch alarm modes if you have registered a **Pushover** app token and API key via the web interface.
   - Press the **A** key to unlock the keypad.
   - Press the **B** key to switch alarm modes.
   - Type your security code **default "0000"** and press **hash**.
   - The Pushover API key will be validated and the alarm mode will switch between active and silent.
   - Press the **A** key to lock the keypad again.

6. **Changing The Security Code**
   - You should change the security code **default "0000"** to keep the system secure.
   - Press the **A** key to unlock the keypad.
   - Press the **C** key to change the security code.
   - Type your current security code **default "0000"** and press **hash**.
   - Type a new security code between 4 and 8 digits and press **hash** if the code is less than 8 digits.
   - Confirm the new security code and press **hash** if the code is less than 8 digits.
   - The security code will now be changed.
   - Press the **A** key to lock the keypad again.

7. **Resetting The Configuration**
   - Resetting the configuration will return all settings to factory defaults.
   - Press the **A** key to unlock the keypad.
   - Press the **D** key to reset the configuration.
   - Type your security code **default "0000"** and press **hash**.
   - Retype your security code and press **hash**.
   - The configuration will reset after 10 seconds, indicated by a low pitch bell.
   - The system will restart to complete the configuration reset.

## Security Considerations
You should change the security code from the default **"0000"** to ensure your system is secure.

You should change the web interface administrative password from the default **"secureme"** to prevent access by unauthorised users.

---

## Usage Scenarios

- **Portable Bag Security**: Attach SecureMe to a bag for motion and tilt detection.
- **Home Monitoring**: Place SecureMe in a room to detect intrusions or unauthorized access.
- **Silent Alarm Setup**: Monitor spaces discreetly with silent push notifications.

## Future Enhancements

The project roadmap includes:
- Support for additional sensors (e.g., ultrasonic).
- Support for remote arming/disarming
